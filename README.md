# Anki Share & Colaborate 2022
Unfinished prototype of an script/application that allows to share decks (collections of flash cards) between Anki mobile/descktop app users. The requirements of the app were:
1. Copy selected deck and transfer it to the selected users
2. Keep track of the selected deck and update each copy whenever anyone updates their copy
3. Give an option to flip all cards in the deck - specially useful when learning a language
  
Requires
1. [Anki for desktop](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
2. [AnkiConnect plugin](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/)
